### Packages in order of dependency

## This file is used by `make(1)' to build the project.  In any line
## of this file, text starting with the character `#' and extending
## until the end of that line is considered a comment.  The `make'
## command, when it uses this file, will elide from it comments and
## blank lines, i.e., lines consisting of whitespace alone.

## Here is an explanation of the contents of this file.  For the
## purposes of this description, I will use the term "Coq root" for
## the subdirectory `UniMath' of the top directory of the project.
## All the Coq files in the project are under the Coq root.

## A "package" is a subdirectory of the Coq root.  The Coq files in a
## package are related to a particular topic in mathematics such as
## algebra or category theory.  This topic is reflected in the name of
## the package directory.

## Below are the names of all the packages in the project.  They are
## listed in order of dependency.  This means that a package may
## depend on some of the packages that are before it in the list, but
## not on any package that is after it in the list.
